      <div>What is Adobe Spark?</div>
      <div>
        <p>Adobe Spark enables you to tell stories and share ideas quickly and beautifully. Spark lets you create three types of content:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Use Page to create a story using text, images, and video. When you’re done we’ll present your story as a responsive web page that can be viewed in any web browser.</li>
          <li>Use Post to create images optimized for social media; you provide images and text and we’ll help with the design. We’ll even help you create the right shape and size image for each social media platform.</li>
          <li>Use Video to create, well, a video. Add videos from your computer or iOS camera roll, overlay text, add your voice and background music, and we’ll help turn your story into an amazing video to share with the world.</li>
        </ul>
